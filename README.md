# AMAZING SYSTEM BOOTSTRAP & CONFIGURATOR

## Why Bother?

This repo is how I manage my local configuration.  
Essentially it's a slightly modular PATH and Environment variable
configuration system using
Shell script basics (making it usable for bash AND zsh.

## USAGE

1. `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jshreynolds/localetc/main/install.sh` > install.sh
2. `chmod 755 install.sh && ./install.sh [[MACHINE_NAME]]`
3. Do what it says
4. Good news, friend! You will have a configured system **JUST LIKE MINE!!!**
